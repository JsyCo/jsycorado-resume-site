    <!-- About Me and Career Aspirations -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me & Career Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
            I am an enthusiastic IT and cybersecurity student with a passion for technology and problem-solving. My career goal is to launch my journey in the IT sector—fixing computers, printers, and resolving tech issues—before eventually moving into cybersecurity. For years, I’ve helped friends and family troubleshoot devices and build custom computers, which has given me hands-on experience and confidence in technical support.
        </p>
        <p>
            I thrive on learning and am committed to staying up to date with the latest technology through continued education and certifications. I enjoy earning certificates because they showcase my progress and deepen my understanding of new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my current role as a cashier at JCPenney, I’ve developed excellent customer service and communication skills, including experience in de-escalating situations and ensuring customers’ needs are met. I look forward to combining my technical skills and people skills to make a positive impact in IT and, eventually, the cybersecurity field.
