                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Jsy Jared Corado. I love helping people solve tech problems and making things work the way they should. After having my own accounts hacked, I know how helpless that can feel—so I want to help others feel safe online and make security easier for everyone. I’ve spent years fixing computers, building PCs, and supporting friends and family, and now I’m eager to start my IT career, keep learning, and eventually move into cybersecurity. My goal is to create solutions that are both secure and convenient, so people can feel protected without extra hassle.

                            In this project, I conducted a forensic investigation on a simulated hard drive to uncover hidden images. I used tools like Autopsy to analyze file systems, metadata, and slack space, and practiced digital evidence handling as well as techniques in steganography detection and forensic analysis.

We added a safety radius feature to alert parents if a child wandered too far. I worked with Android Studio, Firebase, and Google Maps API to make the app responsive and fun for families.

I’ve learned to juggle a fast-paced environment, help with returns and merchandising, and even encourage customers to check out our store credit cards. I enjoy solving problems on the spot and working with a team that supports each other to keep things running smoothly.

It taught me a lot about teamwork, responsibility, and the value of pitching in wherever needed.
